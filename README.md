# spellbook-loot-js
Javascript implementation of spellbook loot

Use the slider to select a level of wizard, this will be used to determine the maximum spell level, and number of spells per level.
This will roughly follow the level progression of a wizard as outlined by the player handbook, and will take into account the disproportionally
larger nunmber of level one spells they will know due to the class progression.

Spells are chosen at random, and duplicates are not allowed, each spellbook will contain the same number of spells, but different ones.

Further development may allow for more granlar user control, school specialty, damaged spellbooks, and more. 

Feedback is encouraged.
